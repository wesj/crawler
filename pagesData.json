Description: Interprofessional teamwork and collaborative practice are emerging as key elements of efficient and productive work in promoting health and treating patients.  The vision for these collaborations is one where different health and/or social professionals share a team identity and work closely together to solve problems and improve delivery of care.  Although the value of interprofessional education (IPE) has been embraced around the world - particularly for its impact on learning - many in leadership positions have questioned how IPE affects patent, population, and health system outcomes. This question cannot be fully answered without well-designed studies, and these studies cannot be conducted without an understanding of the methods and measurements needed to conduct such an analysis.\nThis Institute of Medicine report examines ways to measure the impacts of IPE on collaborative practice and health and system outcomes.  According to this report, it is possible to link the learning process with downstream person or population directed outcomes through thoughtful, well-designed studies of the association between IPE and collaborative behavior.

Additionally, this report presents a conceptual model for evaluating IPE that could be adapted to particular settings in which it is applied.

Witmer","dc.Description":"ABSTRACT A juvenile skull of the tyrannosaurid Tarbosaurus bataar found in the Bugjn Tsav locality in the Mongolian Gobi Desert is described. With a total length of 290 mm, the present specimen represents one of the smallest skulls known for this species. Not surprisingly, it shows various characteristics common to juvenile tyrannosaurids, such as the rostral margin of the maxillary fenestra not reaching that of the external antorbital fenestra and the postorbital lacking the cornual process. The nasal bears a small lacrimal process, which disappears in adults. Lacking some of the morphological characteristics that are adapted for bearing great feeding forces in adult individuals, this juvenile specimen suggests that T. bataar would have changed its dietary niches during ontogeny.

We conducted a 1,505-participant online study to investigate Internet users' perceptions of OBA disclosures while performing an online task. We tested icons, accompanying taglines, and landing pages intended to inform users about OBA and provide opt-out options; these were based on prior research or drawn from those currently in use. The icons, taglines, and landing pages fell short both in terms of notifying participants about OBA and clearly informing participants about their choices. Half of the participants remembered the ads they saw but only 12% correctly remembered the disclosure taglines attached to ads. The majority of participants mistakenly believed that ads would pop up if they clicked on disclosure icons and taglines, and more participants incorrectly thought that clicking the disclosures would let them purchase their own advertisements than correctly understood that they could then opt out of OBA. \"Ad-Choices,\" the tagline most commonly used by online advertisers, was particularly ineffective at communicating notice and choice. 45% of participants who saw \"AdChoices\" believed that it was intended to sell advertising space, while only 27% believed it was an avenue to stop tailored ads. A majority of participants mistakenly believed that opting out would stop all online tracking, not just tailored ads. We discuss challenges in crafting disclosures, and we provide suggestions for improvement.

With a total length of 290 mm, the present specimen represents one of the smallest skulls known for this species. Not surprisingly, it shows various characteristics common to juvenile tyrannosaurids, such as the rostral margin of the maxillary fenestra not reaching that of the external antorbital fenestra and the postorbital lacking the cornual process. The nasal bears a small lacrimal process, which disappears in adults. Lacking some of the morphological characteristics that are adapted for bearing great feeding forces in adult individuals, this juvenile specimen suggests that T. bataar would have changed its dietary niches during ontogeny. The numbers of alveoli in the maxilla (13) and dentary (14 and 15) are the same as those in adults, suggesting that they do not change ontogenetically in T. bataar and thus are not consistent with the hypothesis that the numbers...","dc.Publisher":" Taylor & Francis Group ","dc.Date":"2011-05-09","dc.Type":"research-article","dc.Format":"text/HTML","dc.Identifier":"Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, Vol. 31, No. 3, May 2011, pp. 497–517","dc.Source":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02724634.2011.557116","dc.Language":"en","dc.Coverage":"world","MSSmartTagsPreventParsing":"true","google-translate-customization":"406b679d25c4a652-4738cf93a622f49d-gd9c0d3d47cf6b17a-13"},"dom":645,"visitDate":1450778086363,"_index_":106983},"75144":{"scheme":"http","host":"www.travelsupermarket.com","path":"/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/googleplusicon1.png","port":null,"hash":"","search":"","anchors":[],"links":[402],"scripts":[],"style":[403,404,402],"externalLinks":[],"internalLinks":[75118,75144],"title":"googleplusicon1.png (PNG Image, 80 × 80 pixels)","images":[113],"meta":{"viewport":"width=device-width;

specific information or details, the company revealed that it \"recently identified malware on computers that operate the payment processing systems for Hyatt-managed locations.\" Upon that discovery, it said, it began an investigation with third-party security experts that remains ongoing.\n\nHyatt didn't say how many of its locations were affected, how exactly customer data might be compromised, nor how many customers may be impacted. It did say, though, that it has created a dedicated webpage where it will post updates from the investigation -- that's hyatt.com/protectingourcustomers.\n\nHyatt is just the latest hotelier to get hit by such an attack. Hilton, Starwood and Mandarin Oriental are among the others to have been hacked this year alone.","excerpt":"Hyatt, the global hotel chain with 627 properties across more than 50, countries is the latest in its industry to suffer a cyber security attack.","category":"Security","tag":"hyattt","description":"TechCrunch is a leading technology media property, dedicated to obsessively profiling startups, reviewing new Internet products, and breaking tech news.","application-name":"TechCrunch","msapplication-window":"width=device-width;height=device-height","msapplication-tooltip":"Startup and Technology News","msapplication-task":"name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://techcrunch.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/ad5b2a2b10ddd8fc4e4588abd4e12a84?s=16","st:robots":"follow, index"},"dom":2676,"visitDate":1450949089266,"_index_":6263},"77840":{"scheme":"http","host":"www.turnberryresort.co.uk","path":"/assets/logo.jpg","port":null,"hash":"","search":"","anchors":[],"links":[402],"scripts":[],"style":[403,404,402],"externalLinks":[31547],"internalLinks":[77840],"title":"logo.jpg (JPEG Image, 204 × 204 pixels)","images":[1661],"meta":{"viewport":"width=device-width; height=device-height;"},"dom":9,"visitDate":1450949092312,"_index_":77840},"33229":{"scheme":"http","host":"www.spree7.com","path":"/privacy.php","port":null,"hash":"","search":"","anchors":[133268,133269,133270,133271,133272,133273,133274,133275,33228,133276,133277,33005,133278,133279,133280,133281,133282,133283,133284,133285,133286,133287,133288,33229,133289,133290,133291,133292,133293,133294,133295,60795],"links":[133296,133297],"scripts":[33229],"style":[133297,33229],"externalLinks":[1103],"internalLinks":[33229],"title":"Spree7 | Privacy","images":[1663,1664,1665,1666,1667,1668,1669,1670,1671,1672],"meta":{"author":"Spree7","publisher":"http://www.kreowsky.de","Robots":"INDEX,FOLLOW","verification":"c225e5be7c4957fee2e34f28ff6fe2fe","description":"Realtime Advertising revolutionizes digital advertising.
